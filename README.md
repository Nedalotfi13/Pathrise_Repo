# Pathrise_Repo
Pathrise is an online program that provides 1-on-1 mentorship, training, and advice to help job seekers get the best possible jobs in tech.
On average, for fellows who stay with pathrise after their free trial period, it takes about 4 months to receive a final job offer. However, there is a lot of variation in fellows’ outcomes. Being able to predict how fast every single fellow is going to find a job is crucial for Pathrise business. In this exercise Pathrise provides you with a sample of information they collected from their fellows from the moment they joined the program. Please don’t expect this data set to be perfect, it never happens in the real world.
The main goal of the analysis is to derive insights around: 
1- If a fellow will ultimately be placed at a company
and
2- How long until a placement can be expected.
